### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# MySQL InnoDB log waits incident.
---

This incident type refers to an issue where MySQL InnoDB log writes are stalling. It may result in poor database performance, slow queries, and even server crashes in severe cases. The incident can be triggered by various factors such as high server load, large transaction logs, and insufficient disk space. It requires immediate attention and resolution to prevent any further impact on the system.

### Parameters
```shell
# Environment Variables

export PATH_TO_INNODB_LOG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_MYSQL_LOG="PLACEHOLDER"

export BUFFER_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"

export MY_CNF="PLACEHOLDER"


```

## Debug

### Check MySQL status
```shell
systemctl status mysql
```

### Check disk usage
```shell
df -h
```

### Check InnoDB status
```shell
mysql -e "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\G"
```

### Check InnoDB log file size
```shell
ls -lh ${PATH_TO_INNODB_LOG_FILE}
```

### Check for slow queries
```shell
grep -i "slow" ${PATH_TO_MYSQL_LOG}
```

### Check for errors in MySQL log file
```shell
grep -i "error" ${PATH_TO_MYSQL_LOG}
```

### Check MySQL connections
```shell
netstat -anp | grep mysql
```

### Check server load
```shell
top
```

## Repair

### Set the <buffer_size> parameter to the desired size in bytes
```shell
buffer_size=${BUFFER_SIZE}
```

### Set the <my.cnf> file path to the MySQL configuration file
```shell
my_cnf=${MY_CNF}
```

### Find the transaction log buffer section in the configuration file
```shell
buffer_section=$(grep -n "innodb_log_buffer_size" $my_cnf | cut -d: -f1)
```

### If the buffer section is found, update the buffer size
```shell
if [ ! -z "$buffer_section" ]; then

    sed -i "${buffer_section}s/.*/innodb_log_buffer_size=$buffer_size/" $my_cnf

    echo "Transaction log buffer size updated to $buffer_size bytes"

else

    echo "Transaction log buffer section not found in $my_cnf"

fi
```

### Tune the server settings to allocate more resources to the database and reduce contention for system resources.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash


 NEW_FLUSH_LOG_VALUE="PLACEHOLDER"

 NEW_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"

 NEW_WRITE_IO_THREADS="PLACEHOLDER"

 MYSQL_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

 NEW_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"


# Set the MySQL configuration file path

CONFIG_FILE=${MYSQL_CONFIG_FILE_PATH}



# Set the server settings to allocate more resources to the database

sed -i 's/innodb_buffer_pool_size=.*/innodb_buffer_pool_size=${NEW_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE}/' $CONFIG_FILE

sed -i 's/innodb_log_buffer_size=.*/innodb_log_buffer_size=${NEW_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE}/' $CONFIG_FILE

sed -i 's/innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=.*/innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=${NEW_FLUSH_LOG_VALUE}/' $CONFIG_FILE

sed -i 's/innodb_write_io_threads=.*/innodb_write_io_threads=${NEW_WRITE_IO_THREADS}/' $CONFIG_FILE



# Restart the MySQL service

systemctl restart mysql
